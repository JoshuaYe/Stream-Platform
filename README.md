# Video Streaming Platform

A React-based web streaming platform where content-creators can live-stream, and viewers can browse streams then tune in! 

I learned a ton about Javascript, React, Redux, JSX, RESTful APIs, functional and class-based components, communicating with props, the state system, life cycle methods, calling APIs, web development, and UI design.

This is a project I created for Stephen Grider's React and Redux 2020 course on Udemy.
